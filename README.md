# Project Name: AI-Generated Fake Photo Detection
## Project Description

The AI-Generated Fake Photo Detection project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify fake photos created by AI algorithms. With the rise of generative AI technologies, it has become challenging to differentiate between real and AI-generated images, leading to potential risks in identity verification and online security. The project utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to train a model that can identify specific patterns and inconsistencies indicative of AI-generated content. By achieving this, the project aims to enhance digital security, prevent identity fraud, and maintain trust in online platforms.
