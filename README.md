# Project Name: AI-Generated Image Detection
## Project Description

The AI-Generated Image Detection project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify fake photos created by AI algorithms. With the rise of generative AI technologies, it has become challenging to differentiate between real and AI-generated images, leading to potential risks in identity verification and online security. The project utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to train a model that can identify specific patterns and inconsistencies indicative of AI-generated content. By achieving this, the project aims to enhance digital security, prevent identity fraud, and maintain trust in online platforms.
## Project Objectives

* Develop a model capable of identifying AI-generated fake photos.
* Train the model using a diverse dataset of labeled real and fake images.
* Optimize the model's architecture and parameters for improved performance.
* Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
* Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
* Image processing and computer vision techniques
* Data preprocessing and augmentation
* Model optimization and fine-tuning
* Evaluation metrics and performance analysis
