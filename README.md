# Project Name: AI-Generated Fake Photo Detection
## Project Description

The AI-Generated Fake Photo Detection project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify fake photos created by AI algorithms. With the rise of generative AI technologies, it has become challenging to differentiate between real and AI-generated images, leading to potential risks in identity verification and online security. The project utilizes machine learning and computer vision techniques to train a model that can identify specific patterns and inconsistencies indicative of AI-generated content. By achieving this, the project aims to enhance digital security, prevent identity fraud, and maintain trust in online platforms.
## Project Objectives

Develop a model capable of identifying AI-generated fake photos.
Train the model using a diverse dataset of labeled real and fake images.
Optimize the model's architecture and parameters for improved performance.
Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Technologies Used

Python
Deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
Image processing and computer vision techniques
Data preprocessing and augmentation
Model optimization and fine-tuning
Evaluation metrics and performance analysis
